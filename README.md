# CS2040C_ARCHIVES

This repository contains my **CS2040C Data Structures and Algorithms** practical assignments from my time at NUS.

## About

In CS2040C, I learned fundamental data structures and algorithms using C++, including:

- Arrays and linked lists
- Stacks and queues
- Trees (BST, heaps)
- Hash tables
- Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, shortest paths)
- Sorting and searching techniques
- Analyzing time and space complexity
- Implementing and testing algorithms efficiently

These assignments strengthened my problem-solving skills and taught me to apply core data structures to practical scenarios.
